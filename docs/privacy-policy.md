This application is an open-source project and is a port of the [Asgardex wallet](https://github.com/thorchain/asgardex-electron).

## Data Collection and Use

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information or user data. All private keys and wallet data are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted to any external server controlled by the developer. The app interacts directly with public blockchains to facilitate transactions.

## Third-Party Services

The app may communicate with public blockchain nodes to function (e.g., to fetch balances or broadcast transactions), but this data does not contain personally identifiable information managed by us.

## Contact

For questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/asgardex/asgardex-mobile).
